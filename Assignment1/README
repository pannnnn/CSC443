util.py is the script in order to output the data file and plot the diagram, 
use 'python3 util.py -h' to see the help for this script.

-m is the medium you use to write to and read from. Default is HDD.

-t is the file size. Default is 100 MBytes.

-p is the location you need to specify when you want to write the data to
external drive like usb or hard drive, no need for hdd or sdd. Default is
current directory as script. ('/' is needed at the end of the path to specify
the directory)

Example:
python util.py -m hdd
python util.py -m ssd -t 50
python util.py -m usb -t 100 -p /path/to/your/external/drive/

The script would automatically generate 300 data files which is the result of 
create_random_file and read from them using get_histogram.

This scrip is based on cdf and my local machine. Run "make clean" to clean 
all executables and txt files. If you don't want the plot function, just comment
it out in the script.
